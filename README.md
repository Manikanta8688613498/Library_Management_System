## 📄 Project Description: Library Management System (OOP in Java)
This is a simple Library Management System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. The project simulates the basic functionalities of a library, such as:   
Storing book records   
Managing users   
Issuing and returning books   
It is a console-based (CLI) application built for a Java Developer Internship task to demonstrate understanding of OOP concepts like Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a multi-class Java project that allows:   
Easy management of books and users   
Issuing and returning of books   
Displaying current library status

---

## 🧠 Key OOP Concepts Used   
Abstraction: Defined classes (Book, User, Library) that model real-world entities.   
Encapsulation: All data is kept private inside classes and accessed through public methods.   
Polymorphism: (Optional: Can be extended using method overriding or interfaces.)
